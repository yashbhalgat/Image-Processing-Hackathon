I have written two codes for the algorithm: 

1) finger_extract_with_background_subtraction.m :
This is the main code. It is "more accurate" than the 2nd code.

IMPORTANT: On running this code from the MATLAB terminal, move any body part out of the camera-view for the first 7 seconds. Then you can start- take your hand in the camera view such that the "complete palm" and the fingers are in the view.

Note: This code will work in ANY kind of background. You just have to do the first 7 seconds properly (as described above).
You will observe that the background is subtracted and it runs accurately.


2)finger_extract_with_background_subtraction.m :
This code also runs similarly. This was the initial code, in which I didn't do any background subtraction. So, consider this code just as a supplementary.


VIDEOS:
After running the myself, I created the demo-video. The link:

RESULT:	You will see your fingers detected in the screen by RED coloured boxes. In the MATLAB terminal, the number of fingers and the finger array as described in the PS will be printed.

PS: Please contact me (9892923181) if you get any problem in running and checking the algorithm.
